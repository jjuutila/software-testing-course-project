Software testing course project repo
====================================

This is a repository of our tests for our university project.

All code by us, for the course, is under test/ directory.

Ignore the license.txt we had here, it's not related to our
system under test ([jedit]) but related to the source package
created for our course ([OHJ-3060]).

The source package is/was a snapshot of jedit 4.4-pre1.

If you are on the same course as we are don't copy our tests :) Otherwise our code is licensed as GPL.
